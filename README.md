This is a GatsbyJS and ReactJS web application that was created as a final project for my CSC 496 class. This web application uses the JavaScript libraries Chroma.js and html2canvas to handle the color palette creation and downloading .png images of the palette. This project was created to showcase the features of GatsbyJS and ReactJS, mainly focusing on the ability to create your own ReactJS components.

This project was created by following the [Palette Generator: Playing with React Component State Tutorial](https://medium.com/lets-make-something-up/palette-generator-playing-with-react-component-state-23cb959d1334) on Medium.com as a base that I added my own components to.
